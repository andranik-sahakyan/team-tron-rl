This library provides a variety of different mutli-agent environments to experiment with. In this example, we will be focusing on the Tron environment. Inspired by the 1982 movie, this game features snake-like mechanics where players try to force their opponenets to crash. First, will examine the environment api for exectuing actions and playing a full game of Tron."
