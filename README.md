## Summary

We are interested in exploring the emergence and evolution of cooperative strategies (trapping, sacrificing, communicating, etc) by playing Tron with teams. It is also interesting to see how the behavior of the agents changes as a response to changes in the environment (e.g. imposing constraints on communication, adding obstacles). The input is a grid representing the current game state with cells indicating the current positions of all agents and walls and the output is a direction for each agent.
